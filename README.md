Library Management System developed as part of DSB706 at Regent's University London. 
This Library Management System was created as part of the assessment for the DSB706 module in the MSc Data Science in Business programme at Regent’s University London. It was written in Python language in PyCharm Community Edition 2022.3.1, an open-source Integrated Development Environment (IDE) for the Python programming language developed by JetBrains. 

A library management software is a program that allows librarians to categorise book collections, track checked out books, and keep up to date on member profiles and the books they have borrowed from the library.  A basic library management software typically includes the following features:
•	Cataloguing: The software should allow librarians to catalogue books, including the book's title, author, publisher, ISBN, publication date, edition, and other relevant information.
•	Circulation management: The software should allow librarians to check books in and out, renew book loans, and track due dates.
•	Patron management: The software should allow librarians to manage patron accounts, including creating new accounts, modifying existing accounts, and tracking fines and fees.
•	Search and discovery: The software should allow patrons to search for books by title, author, subject, and other criteria.

However, this program was not written for the use of librarians with a large number of patrons and books that they are required to manage; it was written to manage the significantly smaller personal collection of private collectors who do not need patron management features, and seek to manage their personal collection by recording specific details that they require such as book title, name of the author, etc. for their use. This specific programme enables users to collect data regarding the following details: 
•	The title of the book
•	The name of the author
•	The book’s year of publication 
•	The ISBN-13 code of the book
•	Current location of the book

This is a simple program that, when run, enables a user to choose between 5 options: 

1.	Display all the books currently in the list.
2.	Add a new book to the list. 
3.	Search for a book within the list.
4.	Remove a book from the existing list.
5.	Exit the program.
